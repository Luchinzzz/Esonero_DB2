## :pushpin: Description <a name="description"/>
The aim of the project is to simulate a real post office in order to analyze the critical points and then apply the necessary changes to improve the experience for a customer. You can find the Arena project in **progetto_arena** folder that is divided in three different models:
* modello_base: model designed to apply changes in order to improve the experience at the post office;
* sol_modello_base: first solution applied;
* sol_modello_PASP: second solution where the queue follows an abstract discipline with priority without preemption (PASP).

The report contains all the results obtained during the simulation of the three models and the graphs that summarize the improvements found after applying the changes.
